# HL7 FAST üî•

This organization hosts open source code and reference implementations for the FAST project, which aims to make healthcare interoperability work **at scale**. Three new technologies are deployed to meet this end:

| New Technology | Purpose | Implementation Guide |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| National Directory | Find FHIR endpoints and associated capabilities and attributes, maintaining and validating its accuracy | [fhir-directory-exchange](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-directory-exchange/), [fhir-directory-query](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-directory-query), [fhir-directory-attestation](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-directory-attestation) |
| UDAP Security | Security for Scalable Registration, Authentication, and Authorization | [fhir-udap-security-ig](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-udap-security-ig/) |
| Digital Identity & Patient Matching | Interoperable Digital Identity and Patient Matching | [fhir-identity-matching-ig](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-identity-matching-ig/) |
